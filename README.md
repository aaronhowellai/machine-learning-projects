# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

#### **Please note:**

*The **Open in colab** button for viewing Python Notebooks in Google Colab, has had some issues in recent months, so if it does not work, please download the raw file and view in an IDE like Jupyter Lab or VSCode to see and interact with the full project.*

A curated collection of hands-on **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** mini-projects, experiments, and pipelines — developed using real-world datasets, modern libraries, and academic theory in action.

## 💼 About Me

After reading the UK [National AI Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy) in 2022, I predicted a rapid shift in the global workforce economy and began my journey into STEM and Artificial Intelligence, culminating in a 1st Class Degree in Automotive and Transport Design from Coventry University with a STEM-flavoured itch to scratch at Postgraduate level.

### Backstory

#### First Encounters with Deep Learning
As I mentioned briefly above, I read the UK's [National AI Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy) in 2022, which informed me of the government's plan to scale-up and commit massive investment and sponsorship of AI through UKRI and Innovate UK, and decided that I was ready to embark on a journey to STEM, but that's not all. Before that, I:
  - Read Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark twice between 2018-19, and was instantly hooked
  - Designed several Autonomous Cars for the year 2030, and learned about LiDAR and Computer Vision for Autonomous Driving to better inform design philosophy
    - Most cars that my classmates and I were tasked with designing were to use SAE Level 5 Technology (Fully Autonomous Driving)

#### "The Nail in The Coffin"
- In October 2022, I was invited to compete in the [Sir William Lyons Award at the Royal College of Art](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmileshowell/details/honors/), London, as a Finalist with 3 other contestants, with £2.5k to be won each.
- By this time, I had already read Max Tegmark's book and had decided that for my presentation to the judge panel, including a former design director at Rolls-Royce and the London Lord Mayor, I would offer a dedicated section off-script to discuss the future of Artificial Intelligence.
- For this section, I showed the panellists a screenshot of a YouTube channel that my design mentor and I had created with a [GenAI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBaW1OIgTo) we had created together that to this day has amassed **2.1 million views** (and is monetised), using a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model and Midjourney along with some animation tools.
  - This video that we made was pre-video-generation days, so it went viral due to being considered **State of the Art**
- The panellists were so impressed with the foresight to include a discussion about AI that all my post-presentation Q&A was spent having a discussion about it, probing my opinions about the future of work in the Automotive industry in the dawn of generative workflows.
##### The Gut Punch
- When the awards were presented, every contestant except me was awarded £2.5k, with one being awarded £5k instead of me getting a share, as had happened in previous competition years.
  - This is because it was explained to me afterwards that they felt that the other contestants would use the money better for a career in automotive design specifically, whereas they could see that I was heading in a different direction.
  - The London Lord Mayor said, "You would have won an award in the future, but your presentation was 5 years too advanced"
  - Another panellist said, "I don't know what it is you will go on to do, but you're going to do great things"
  - While I had partially felt like I had missed lectures to travel to London for a disappointing end, I took home those 2 aforementioned encouragements that I will remember for the rest of my life, along with a burning determination to change my future before it changed around me. 

### Present Day
I'm currently on a gap year to gain industry experience from an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at the University of the West of England (UWE), resuming in September 2026 (completing in May 2027), and recently completed a 6-month internship as a **Software Development Intern** at Independent Composites Ltd sponsored by Made Smarter UK (An Innovate UK scheme). 

*( Currently seeking paid internships in AI/ML with flexible durations, 2 weeks notice )*

I have also recently been awarded 2x Scholarships and a Youth Development Award from the King's Trust:
- [O'Reilly DEI Data Science Scholarship (2025-2026 Winner)](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/3468)
