## üíº About Me

After reading the UK [National AI Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy) in 2022, I predicted a rapid shift in the global workforce economy and began my journey into STEM and Artificial Intelligence, culminating in a 1st Class Degree in Automotive and Transport Design from Coventry University with a STEM-flavoured itch to scratch at Postgraduate level.

### Backstory

#### First Encounters with Deep Learning
As I mentioned briefly above, I read the UK's [National AI Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy) in 2022, which informed me of the government's plan to scale-up and commit massive investment and sponsorship of AI through UKRI and Innovate UK, and decided that I was ready to embark on a journey to STEM, but that's not all. Before that, I:
  - Read Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark twice between 2018-19, and was instantly hooked
  - Designed several Autonomous Cars for the year 2030, and learned about LiDAR and Computer Vision for Autonomous Driving to better inform design philosophy
    - Most cars that my classmates and I were tasked with designing were to use SAE Level 5 Technology (Fully Autonomous Driving)

#### "The Nail in The Coffin"
- In October 2022, I was invited to compete in the [Sir William Lyons Award at the Royal College of Art](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmileshowell/details/honors/), London, as a Finalist with 3 other contestants, with ¬£2.5k to be won each.
- By this time, I had already read Max Tegmark's book and had decided that for my presentation to the judge panel, including a former design director at Rolls-Royce and the London Lord Mayor, I would offer a dedicated section off-script to discuss the future of Artificial Intelligence.
- For this section, I showed the panellists a screenshot of a YouTube channel that my design mentor and I had created with a [GenAI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBaW1OIgTo) we had created together that to this day has amassed **2.1 million views** (and is monetised), using a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model and Midjourney along with some animation tools.
  - This video that we made was pre-video-generation days, so it went viral due to being considered **State of the Art**
- The panellists were so impressed with the foresight to include a discussion about AI that all my post-presentation Q&A was spent having a discussion about it, probing my opinions about the future of work in the Automotive industry in the dawn of generative workflows.
##### The Gut Punch
- When the awards were presented, every contestant except me was awarded ¬£2.5k, with one being awarded ¬£5k instead of me getting a share, as had happened in previous competition years.
  - This is because it was explained to me afterwards that they felt that the other contestants would use the money better for a career in automotive design specifically, whereas they could see that I was heading in a different direction.
  - The London Lord Mayor said, "You would have won an award in the future, but your presentation was 5 years too advanced"
  - Another panellist said, "I don't know what it is you will go on to do, but you're going to do great things"
  - While I had partially felt like I had missed lectures to travel to London for a disappointing end, I took home those 2 aforementioned encouragements that I will remember for the rest of my life, along with a burning determination to change my future before it changed around me. 

### Present Day
I'm currently on a gap year to gain industry experience from an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at the University of the West of England (UWE), resuming in September 2026 (completing in May 2027), and recently completed a 6-month internship as a **Software Development Intern** at Independent Composites Ltd sponsored by Made Smarter UK (An Innovate UK scheme). 

*( Currently seeking paid internships in AI/ML with flexible durations, 2 weeks notice )*

I have also recently been awarded 2x Scholarships and a Youth Development Award from the King's Trust:

- [Youth Development Award (2024 Winner)](https://fis.wandsworth.gov.uk/kb5/wandsworth/fsd/service.page?id=A7qrHcKzKKw)
