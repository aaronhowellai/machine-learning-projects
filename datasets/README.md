# **/ datasets** ðŸ’¾
* This directory is for **uploading datasets that I use in my Python notebooks** so that they can be **run straight out of the box** without experiencing errors related to the data-loading directory cells being incorrect (because of the fact that my local directories are different to everyone else's). 

* Hosting my own version of a dataset on a GitHub repository directory instead of referencing Kaggle directly also prevents:
  * Experiencing an error related to broken or missing links
  * Datasets being overwritten by the original uploader
